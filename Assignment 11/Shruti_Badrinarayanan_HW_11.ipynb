      "The main challenge addressed by the paper in the field of super-resolution is the recovery of finer texture details when super-resolving at large upscaling factors. The optimization-based super-resolution methods are driven by the choice of the objective function, with recent work focusing on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. However, this approach often results in high peak signal-to-noise ratios but lacks high-frequency details and perceptual fidelity at higher resolutions.\n",

      "To tackle this challenge, the SRGAN proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution. The SRGAN introduces a perceptual loss function that consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes the solution towards the natural image manifold using a discriminator network trained to differentiate between super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. The content loss is motivated by perceptual similarity rather than pixel-wise similarity.\n",

      "By using a deep residual network and the proposed perceptual loss function, SRGAN is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images. Extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) testing shows significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN, with scores closer to those of the original high-resolution images than any state-of-the-art method. This demonstrates the effectiveness of SRGAN in addressing the challenge of recovering fine texture details in super-resolution.\n"
